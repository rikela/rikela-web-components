This is an example of a tree item.
A tree item consists of an icon (either collapse or expand) a name and its content.
Several of these WebComponents can be built up to a tree.

The css classes '.toggle' and '.content' are needed for access to the elements in the DOM.

This example was created with the Dart plugin for eclipse.
